# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program

a=16 
print(bin(a)

## Output
<img width="507" height="233" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7706a4d-d381-4247-8b1c-5450e3f2b67a" />

## Result
Thus the program is executed successfully.
